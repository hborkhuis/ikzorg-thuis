It is safe to organize themes into subdirectories and is recommended to use
Drupal's sub-theme functionality to ensure easy maintenance and upgrades.

In multisite configuration, themes found in this directory are available to
all sites. Alternatively, the sites/your_site_name/themes directory pattern may
be used to restrict themes to a specific site instance.

Refer to the "Appearance" section of the README.txt in the Drupal root
directory for further information on theming.
